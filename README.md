# 🚇 Kanpur Metro App (Orange Line)

A C++ console application that efficiently navigates the **Kanpur Metro (Orange Line)** network. It calculates the shortest path, distance, and estimated travel time between stations ranging from **IIT Kanpur** to **Kanpur Central**.

## 🌟 Features
- **Route Visualization:** Displays the linear connectivity map of the metro network.
- **Shortest Path Finder:** Utilizes **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** to determine the route with the minimum number of stops.
- **Trip Calculator:** Uses **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to compute the shortest distance (in KM) and estimated time (in Minutes).
- **Station Directory:** dynamic listing of all operational stations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Algorithms
- **Language:** C++ (Standard Template Library)
- **Data Structure:** Graph (Adjacency List)
- **Algorithms:** - `Dijkstra's Algorithm` (Weighted shortest path)
  - `BFS` (Unweighted shortest path)
  - `DFS` (Map traversal)

## 📍 Stations Covered
The application covers the Priority Corridor and recent extensions:
`IIT Kanpur` ↔ `Kalyanpur` ↔ `SPM Hospital` ↔ `Vishwavidyalaya` ↔ `Gurudev Chauraha` ↔ `Geeta Nagar` ↔ `Rawatpur` ↔ `LLR Hospital` ↔ `Moti Jheel` ↔ `Chunniganj` ↔ `Naveen Market` ↔ `Bada Chauraha` ↔ `Nayaganj` ↔ `Kanpur Central`
